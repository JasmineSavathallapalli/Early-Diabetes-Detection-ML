# Early-Diabetes-Detection-ML
Early Detection of Diabetes Using Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning Models

This project explores multiple machine learning models to detect diabetes at an early stage.

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- SVM
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- Naive Bayes
- MLP Neural Network
- Unsupervised: KMeans, DBSCAN (for evaluation)

## Evaluation
Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- ROC Curve
- New input prediction

## üìÅ Files Included
- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `.pkl` files: Saved trained models
- `README.md`: Project overview

##  Demo
Test real inputs and get prediction using the trained models.

##  Conclusion
Supervised models like KNN, MLP, and Extra Trees perform best. Unsupervised models are not suitable for this classification task.
